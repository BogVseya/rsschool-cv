### About Me:
I came to Moscow from the city of Perm to study here at a university. I am a very purposeful person and I want to be successful in life. Also I have an analytical mindset and creativity in one bottle:). Because My specialty disappointed me, I decided to do self-education and chose the front-end. 

My programming experience started in school, where I tried to writing simple websites, but by the end of my studies I gave up this. And now, after a long time, I returned to this. I am going to develop and reach the top of success in this area.
